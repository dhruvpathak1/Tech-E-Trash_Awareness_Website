# **Tech-E Trash: A Comprehensive E-Waste Awareness Website**



### **Project Description**

Tech-E Trash is a web programming project created to raise awareness about the increasing global issue of e-waste and promote responsible disposal practices. The website provides a user-friendly interface with multiple features to educate and assist users in tackling e-waste. The projectâ€™s motto is **"For the E-Future Ahead,"** emphasizing the need for responsible measures to prevent discarded technology from harming our planet.



### **Technical Overview**

The website was developed using the **ReactJS library** on the **NodeJS framework**. The development was specifically done on **Gatsby**, an open-source framework based on React. For deployment, the application uses **Heroku**. User sign-up and login functionalities are managed through a database built with **phpMyAdmin** and **mySQL**, and are connected to the website using **PHP**.



### **Key Features**

The website is designed with several modules to provide a rich and informative user experience:

* **Responsive Design**: The website is largely responsive and correctly adjusts for different screen sizes on mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.
* **User Authentication**: The header includes a "User" button that opens a modal for users to sign up or log in.
* **Live E-Waste Count**: The home page features an **API** that displays the real-time tons of e-waste being dumped globally.
* **AI Chat Box**: An AI Chat Box is available on every page to assist first-time users. It provides answers to four general e-waste-related questions with correct answers, emojis, and images.
* **Interactive E-Waste Information**:
    * **Know Your Waste Page**: This page allows users to get information about an electronic device they select, including the detrimental effects it would have on the environment if not disposed of properly.
    * **Journey of a Device Page**: This module uses a timeline animation that depicts the life of an electronic device and how it ends up in a waste land.
    * **Impact of E-Waste Page**: This section uses various animated **infographics** to share alarming data about e-waste and suggest solutions.
* **Google My Maps API**: A crucial feature is the use of the **Google My Maps API** to display over **150 real locations of e-waste recyclers in India**, helping users find the nearest disposal centers.
* **Footer**: The footer contains navigation links, a properly working contact form, and links to the creators' personal websites, GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles.



### **Future Scope**

The creators plan to continuously improve the website with more utilities and functionalities. Future enhancements include:

* **User Profile Section**: Developing a dedicated user profile section for a smoother user experience.
* **Event Page**: Creating an event page to help NGOs gain attraction for their e-waste initiatives.
* **E-Waste Pick-up Option**: Adding a convenient e-waste pick-up service for customers to further assist with proper disposal.

This project stands as a testament to using technology for a greater cause, aiming to make people aware of their responsibility towards the planet and helping them take action against the global e-waste problem.
