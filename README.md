# **Tech-E Trash: A Comprehensive E-Waste Awareness Website**

<br>

Tech-E Trash is a web programming project built to raise awareness about the growing global issue of e-waste and promote responsible disposal practices[cite: 43, 45, 127]. Developed as part of a B.Tech (Computer Engineering) program, the website provides a user-friendly interface with multiple features to educate and assist users in tackling e-waste[cite: 11, 45, 54, 131]. The projectâ€™s motto is **"For the E-Future Ahead,"** emphasizing the need for responsible measures to prevent discarded technology from destroying our future[cite: 52, 60].

### **Technical Overview**

<br>

The project was developed using the **ReactJS library** on the **NodeJS framework**, with development done on the **Gatsby** open-source framework[cite: 44, 114]. The application is deployed using **Heroku**[cite: 44, 115]. User sign-up and login functionalities are managed through a database built with **phpMyAdmin** and **mySQL**, and connected to the website using **PHP**[cite: 116, 117].

The website is designed with several modules to provide a rich and informative user experience[cite: 62]:

* **Responsive Design**: The website is largely responsive and correctly adjusts for different screen sizes on mobile phones, tablets, and laptops[cite: 73].
* **User Authentication**: The header includes a "User" button that opens a modal for users to sign up or log in, managed through a mySQL database[cite: 64, 116].
* **Live E-Waste Count**: The home page features an **API** that displays the real-time tons of e-waste being dumped globally[cite: 77, 78].
* **AI Chat Box**: An AI Chat Box is available on every page to assist users[cite: 68]. It provides answers to four general e-waste-related questions with correct answers, emojis, and images[cite: 70, 71].
* **Interactive E-Waste Information**:
    * **Know Your Waste Page**: This page allows users to get information about an electronic device they select, including the detrimental effects it would have on the earth if not disposed of properly[cite: 56, 83].
    * **Journey of a Device Page**: This module uses a timeline animation that depicts the life of an electronic device and how it ends up in a waste land[cite: 89, 91].
    * **Impact of E-Waste Page**: This section uses various animated **infographics** to share alarming data about e-waste and suggest solutions[cite: 93, 94, 96, 97].
* **Google My Maps API**: A crucial feature is the use of the **Google My Maps API** to display over **150 real locations of e-waste recyclers in India**, helping users find the nearest disposal centers[cite: 98, 99].
* **Footer**: The footer contains navigation links, a properly working contact form, and links to the creators' personal websites, GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles[cite: 65, 66, 67].
