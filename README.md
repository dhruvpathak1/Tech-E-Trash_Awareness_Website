In this project a website has been made using the ReactJS library on the NodeJS framework,
wherein the development was done on a React-based open source framework “Gatsby” and the
deployment of the app was done using Heroku.
E-Waste is the topic chosen for this project. As we all know technology is improving at a rapid
pace like never before. Though this seems to be a positive growth, it has left negative effects on
our planet. There has been a drastic increase in the volume of e-waste all around the world leading
to more than 80% of it being dumped in landfills. This waste has the potential to be reused and to
help the environment in multiple ways.
The e-waste thrown away can be used to extract reusable components and elements which not only
helps in it becoming useful, but, it also decreases the need to mine and produce newer components.
Waste when properly disposed, results in less pollution on earth. By recycling these e-wastes,
minimum harm is caused to the planet as mining and factories will have less effects on the planet
when reusable elements are recycled. To help spread this information and to make people aware
about their responsibility towards the society, this website was made, thereby named “Tech-E
Trash”, with a motto - For the E-Future Ahead.

Tech-E-Trash is a website that provides a user-friendly interface and has multiple functionalities
helping in various aspects of e-waste awareness. From locating different e-waste collection centers
to making the users aware of the different steps of disposal their phone faces after they are dumped.
A very informative function of the website lies in the “know your waste” page, wherein input is
taken from the user asking about their device after which, he/she is made aware of the detrimental
effect their device would have on the earth if not disposed properly. Building on the above
information, a page is dedicated entirely to make the users aware of the impact that e-waste has on
the environment. A section of the website has a map with 150+ e-waste recycles and their details
to help users in disposing off the e-waste in a manner that does not harm the future of the planet.
Therefore, the aim to educate and make people aware that an E-Future is only possible if and only
if responsible measures are taken. Otherwise the technologically perfect future that is dreamt of
would be destroyed by the old discarded technology.
